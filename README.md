italian model generator
=============================

This program uses various sources (WordNet, ConceptNet, and en.wiktionary) in order to generate different dataset regarding the Italian language, specifically:

 * A basic English -> Italian dictionary (this is actually just a precondition for the other steps)
 * A list of Italian hyponym/hypernym
 * A list of Italian PoS tags
 * A list of Italian verb conjugations

The data is produced both as TSV files and a single SQLLite database
